## 1. What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?

###  Simulator

A **simulator** is a software tool that checks your digital circuit’s functionality by applying test inputs and viewing outputs. This helps you verify your design before hardware implementation.

###  Design

The **design** is your Verilog code describing the intended logic functionality.

###  Testbench

A **testbench** is a simulation environment that applies various inputs to your design and checks if the outputs are correct.



## 2. Getting Started with iverilog

**iverilog** is an open-source simulator for Verilog. Here’s the typical simulation flow:

- Both the design and testbench are provided as input to iverilog.
- The simulator produces a `.vcd` file for waveform viewing in GTKWave.

## 3. Lab: Simulating a 2-to-1 Multiplexer

Let’s simulate a simple **2-to-1 multiplexer** using iverilog!

###  Step 1: Clone the Workshop Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/
cd verilog_files
```

###  Step 2: Install required tools (Ignore if done already)

```shell
sudo apt install iverilog
sudo apt install gtkwave
```

###  Step 3: Simulate the Design

Compile the design and testbench:

```shell
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

Run the simulation:

```shell
./a.out
```

View the waveform:

```shell
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

## 4. Verilog Code Analysis

**The code for the multiplexer (`good_mux.v`):**

```verilog
module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
    if(sel)
        y <= i1;
    else 
        y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```

###  **How It Works**

- **Inputs:** `i0`, `i1` (data), `sel` (select line)
- **Output:** `y` (output)
- **Logic:** If `sel` is 0, `y` gets `i0`; if `sel` is 1, `y` gets `i1`.

## 5. Introduction to Yosys & Gate Libraries

###  What is Yosys?

**Yosys** is a an open-source synthesis tool for digital hardware. It takes your Verilog code and converts it into a gate-level netlist—a hardware blueprint.

#### Yosys Features

- **Synthesis:** Converts HDL to a logic circuit
- **Optimization:** Improves speed or area
- **Technology Mapping:** Matches logic to actual hardware cells
- **Verification:** Checks correctness
- **Extensibility:** Supports custom flows

###  Why Do Libraries Have Different Gate "Flavors"?

A `.lib` file contains many versions of each gate (like AND, OR, NOT) with different properties:

- **Performance:** Faster gates for critical paths, slower for power savings
- **Power:** Some gates use less energy
- **Area:** Smaller gates for compact chips
- **Drive Strength:** Stronger gates to drive more load
- **Signal Integrity:** Specialized gates for noise/performance
- **Mapping:** Synthesis tools pick the best flavor for your needs

## 6. Synthesis Lab with Yosys

Let’s synthesize the `good_mux` design using Yosys!

###  Step-by-Step Yosys Flow

1. **Start Yosys**
    ```shell
    yosys
    ```

2. **Read the liberty library**
    ```shell
    read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
    ```

3. **Read the Verilog code**
    ```shell
    read_verilog good_mux.v
    ```

4. **Synthesize the design**
    ```shell
    synth -top good_mux
    ```
![yosys syntax](../Day1/yosys_syntax.png)

5. **Technology mapping**
    ```shell
    abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
    ```

6. **Visualize the gate-level netlist**
    ```shell
    show
    ```
