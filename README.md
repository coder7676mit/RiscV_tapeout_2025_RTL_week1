## Week 1 structure

- Verilog RTL design and simulation
- Using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis
- Logic synthesis using Yosys and the SKY130 open-source PDK
- Key digital design concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and optimization techniques

- [Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis](Day1/README.md)
- [Day 2: Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, and Efficient Flip-Flop Coding](Day2/README.md)
- [Day 3: Combinational and Sequential Optimization](Day3/README.md)
- [Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch ](Day4/README.md)
- [Day 5: Optimization in Synthesis ](Day5/README.md)
- [ISSUES](../ISSUES!!!!!!!/README.md)

Each dayâ€™s README includes:
- Clear explanations of the dayâ€™s concepts
- Step-by-step practical labs with code and screenshots
- Tips and best practices for RTL design
